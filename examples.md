## Tips for Effective Use

1. **Be specific in your requests** - Provide all necessary details when asking Claude to perform blockchain operations.

2. **Verify sensitive operations** - Double-check addresses and amounts when transferring funds or deploying contracts.

3. **Use testnet for experiments** - Always use the Base Sepolia testnet for experimentation and development before moving to mainnet.

4. **Keep your configuration secure** - Remember that your Claude Desktop configuration contains sensitive information. Keep it secure and don't share it.

5. **Understand gas costs** - Be aware that blockchain transactions require gas fees. Make sure you have enough ETH to cover these fees.

6. **Verify contract interactions** - When interacting with smart contracts, verify the contract address and function parameters before confirming transactions.

7. **Use onramp responsibly** - When onramping funds, be aware of any fees or limits that may apply.
